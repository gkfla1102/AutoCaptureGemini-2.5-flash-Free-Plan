Edited on 2025-12-07 10:46. : Gemini-2.5-flash free usage reduced from 250 to 20. Google made the change, and it may revert or change again, so we'll have to keep an eye on it.

If you're going to pay for it, using the **GPT version is a bit better** since the responses render more smoothly.
But you could try the Gemini 2.5 Flash version suggested in this post for testing before making a decision.
